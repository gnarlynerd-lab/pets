## 🚀 How to Run the MVP

### Backend
```bash
cd /Users/gerardlynn/agents/dks
export PYTHONPATH=/Users/gerardlynn/agents/dks
python -m uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd /Users/gerardlynn/agents/dks/next
npm run dev
```

### All-in-One
```bash
cd /Users/gerardlynn/agents/dks
./start_mvp.sh
```

## 📱 User Experience

1. **Pet appears** as an animated emoji character (😊, 🤔, 😴, etc.)
2. **User selects emojis** from 4 categories:
   - Expressions: 😊😔😴🤔😋😆😍🥰😌😎
   - Needs: 🍎🍕🎮💤🤗🚿🎯⚽📚🎵
   - Responses: ❤️👍👎❓✨🎉💔😤🙏👋
   - Modifiers: ❓✨🔥💫⭐💨⚡🌟💝🎊

3. **Pet responds** with appropriate emoji based on:
   - Current emotional state
   - Learned user preferences
   - FEP surprise minimization

4. **Pet evolves** personality traits:
   - Playfulness increases with 🎮⚽
   - Affection grows with ❤️🤗
   - Curiosity develops with 🤔❓

## 🧠 Technical Features

### Free Energy Principle Integration
- **Predictive Coding**: Pet maintains models of user behavior
- **Active Inference**: Emoji responses minimize prediction error
- **Surprise Minimization**: Learning reduces unexpected interactions
- **Belief Updating**: Internal models evolve with experience

### Emoji Communication System
```python
# Example interaction
user_input = "😊🍎"  # Happy + hungry
pet_response = "🍕✨"  # Pizza + sparkle (learned preference)
surprise_level = 0.2  # Low surprise = familiar interaction
confidence = 0.8      # High confidence in response
```

### Trait Evolution
```python
# Traits evolve based on interaction patterns
if '🎮' in user_emojis:
    pet.traits['playfulness'] += 0.02
if '❤️' in user_emojis:
    pet.traits['affection'] += 0.02
```

## 🎯 MVP Success Metrics - All Achieved

- [x] **Pet communicates clearly through emojis**
- [x] **User can easily respond with emoji reactions**
- [x] **Pet's emoji usage changes based on user feedback**
- [x] **Personality traits visibly evolve over time**

- [x] **No confusion about consciousness - clearly a pet toy**

## 🔄 What's Working

1. **Emoji Vocabulary System**: 40+ emojis categorized and mapped to emotions
2. **FEP Learning**: Pet learns user preferences and minimizes surprise
3. **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket support for instant responses
4. **Personality Evolution**: Traits change based on interaction patterns
5. **Modern UI**: Beautiful, responsive interface with animations
6. **API Integration**: Frontend seamlessly connects to backend
7. **Memory System**: Interactions stored and influence future behavior

## 🚀 Ready for Demonstration

The MVP is **complete and functional**. Both backend and frontend are implemented with:
- Full emoji communication system
- FEP-based learning and adaptation
- Modern React/Next.js interface
- Real-time pet-user interactions
