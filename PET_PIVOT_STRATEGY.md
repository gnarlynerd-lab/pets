# DKS Digital Pet System: Implementation Strategy

## Project Pivot: From Hospital Resource Management to Digital Pets

We're pivoting our DKS (Dynamic Kinetic Systems) framework from hospital resource management to an evolving digital pet system. This document outlines how we'll transform our existing foundation to implement the vision described in PET_PROPOSAL.md.

## Why This Pivot Makes Sense

Our DKS foundation provides an excellent starting point for digital pets because:

1. **Core DKS Principles Align**: Both projects rely on emergent intelligence through self-organization
2. **Agent Architecture is Compatible**: The DKSAgent base class can be adapted to DigitalPet classes
3. **Memory Systems Transfer**: Our multi-level memory systems are critical for pet personality development
4. **Interaction Patterns Apply**: Connection strengths and adaptation mechanics work for pet-human bonds
5. **Visualization Foundation Exists**: Our D3.js network visualization can show pet trait relationships

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation Adaptation (3-5 days)

1. **Convert Agent Types**:
   - Transform base DKSAgent into DigitalPetAgent
   - Replace Ward/Staff/Equipment/Patient with TraitNetwork/BehaviorSystem/MemorySystem/AttentionState

2. **Modify Communication Layer**:
   - Adapt message system for pet-human interactions
   - Update Redis implementation for attention tracking

3. **Transform Database Schema**:
   - Refactor agent_states to pet_states
   - Add tables for user accounts, pet ownership, and interaction history

4. **Update Visualization**:
   - Convert network visualization to show pet trait networks
   - Create pet rendering system using SVG/CSS

### Phase 2: Pet Evolution Core (5-7 days)

1. **Implement Evolution Engine**:
   - Create TraitNetwork class with interconnected traits
   - Build reinforcement mechanisms based on attention
   - Implement TraitMutation system for personality evolution

2. **Build Behavior System**:
   - Create behavioral patterns based on trait combinations
   - Implement behavior activation thresholds
   - Add random behavior mutation with persistence

3. **Develop Memory Systems**:
   - Adapt our existing memory system for pet-specific memories
   - Add user recognition and preferences
   - Create episodic memory for significant interactions

4. **Implement Attention System**:
   - Create time-decay mechanism for attention
   - Add attention thresholds for pet health
   - Build differential attention response based on pet personality

### Phase 3: User Experience & Interaction (7-10 days)

1. **Create Pet Visualization**:
   - Design visual representation system for pets
   - Add animation for pet behaviors
   - Implement visual indicators for pet state (health, mood, etc.)

2. **Build Interaction Interface**:
   - Create action buttons for feeding, playing, training
   - Add system for special interactions based on pet traits
   - Implement response visualization

3. **Develop Dashboard**:
   - Create pet health/mood monitors
   - Add trait visualization network
   - Build interaction history display
   - Implement metrics for pet development

4. **Pet Lifecycle Management**:
   - Add aging mechanisms
   - Implement health system with consequences
   - Create death/birth mechanics

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (10+ days)

1. **Multi-Pet Dynamics**:
   - Enable pet-to-pet interactions
   - Implement social behaviors
   - Create relationship formation mechanics

2. **Breeding System**:
   - Build trait inheritance system
   - Add mutation chance during reproduction
   - Create compatibility mechanisms

3. **Token Economy** (optional):
   - Implement token interfaces
   - Add marketplace functionality
   - Create value metrics for pets

## Technical Mapping from Current System

### Agent Classes

| Current Class | New Class | Adaptation Required |
|--------------|-----------|---------------------|
| DKSAgent | DigitalPet | Add trait network, attention system |
| WardAgent | TraitNetwork | Replace resource management with trait connections |
| StaffAgent | BehaviorSystem | Replace scheduling with behavior activation |
| EquipmentAgent | AttentionHandler | Replace allocation with attention tracking |
| PatientAgent | NeedsSystem | Replace treatment with need satisfaction |

### Database Schema

| Current Table | New Table | Changes |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| agent_states | pet_states | Add trait network, behavior history |
| interactions | pet_interactions | Focus on human-pet interactions |
| simulation_runs | pet_lifecycles | Track pet development over time |
| metrics | pet_metrics | Measure personality development |
| connection_strengths | trait_connections | Track strength between traits |

### Key New Components

1. **EvolutionEngine**: Manages trait development based on interaction patterns
2. **BehaviorGenerator**: Creates behaviors from trait combinations
3. **AttentionTracker**: Monitors and reacts to human attention patterns
4. **PetVisualizer**: Renders the pet based on its traits and state
5. **UserInteractionInterface**: Allows humans to interact with their pets

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Create DigitalPet base class from our DKSAgent
2. Implement basic TraitNetwork system
3. Create simple visualization for a pet
4. Build rudimentary interaction system
5. Test core evolution mechanics

## Success Metrics

- Pets develop distinct personalities based on interaction patterns
- Pets show attachment to specific users
- Trait networks evolve in response to attention
- Behaviors emerge that weren't explicitly programmed
- Users form emotional connections to their pets

This pivot leverages our existing DKS foundation while redirecting it toward an exciting and potentially more engaging implementation.
