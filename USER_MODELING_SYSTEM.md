# User Modeling System for Digital Pets

## Overview

Digital pets need to develop rich, personalized relationships with their users. This requires sophisticated user modeling that goes beyond simple interaction counting to include personality recognition, preference learning, emotional memory, and adaptive relationship dynamics.

## Core User Modeling Components

### 1. **User Personality Recognition**

**What pets learn about users:**
- **Interaction Style**: Aggressive, gentle, playful, serious, nurturing
- **Communication Patterns**: Emoji usage frequency, response times, message length
- **Attention Patterns**: When they're most active, how long they stay engaged
- **Emotional Tendencies**: What makes them happy, sad, frustrated, excited
- **Consistency**: How reliable/predictable they are in interactions

**Implementation:**
```python
class UserPersonalityModel:
    def __init__(self, user_id):
        self.user_id = user_id
        self.interaction_style = {}  # Aggressive: 0.3, Gentle: 0.7, etc.
        self.communication_patterns = {}
        self.attention_patterns = {}
        self.emotional_signatures = {}
        self.consistency_score = 0.5
        self.confidence_level = 0.0  # How certain we are about this user
```

### 2. **Rich User Memory System**

**Multi-level memory structure:**
- **Episodic Memory**: Specific interaction events with emotional context
- **Semantic Memory**: Generalized knowledge about user preferences
- **Emotional Memory**: How interactions made the pet feel
- **Pattern Memory**: Recognized behavioral patterns and routines
- **Relationship Memory**: Evolution of the relationship over time

**Memory consolidation:**
- Recent interactions are vivid and detailed
- Older memories become generalized patterns
- Important/emotional events are preserved longer
- Negative experiences are remembered but can be overcome

### 3. **User Preference Learning**

**What pets learn:**
- **Favorite Activities**: Which interactions the user enjoys most
- **Preferred Communication**: Emoji styles, conversation topics
- **Timing Preferences**: When user is most responsive/engaged
- **Boundary Recognition**: What upsets or pleases the user
- **Adaptation Patterns**: How user responds to pet's behavior changes

**Learning mechanisms:**
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Positive interactions strengthen preferences
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying recurring user behaviors
- **Context Awareness**: Understanding situational factors
- **Adaptive Responses**: Adjusting behavior based on user reactions

### 4. **Relationship Dynamics**

**Relationship dimensions:**
- **Trust**: How much the pet trusts the user's intentions
- **Familiarity**: How well the pet knows the user
- **Affection**: Emotional bond strength
- **Dependence**: How much the pet relies on the user
- **Respect**: Recognition of user's role and boundaries

**Relationship evolution:**
- **Formation Phase**: Initial interactions, building familiarity
- **Development Phase**: Deepening understanding and trust
- **Maturity Phase**: Stable, nuanced relationship
- **Adaptation Phase**: Responding to user changes over time

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Enhanced User Memory
```python
class EnhancedUserMemory:
    def __init__(self):
        self.user_profiles = {}  # user_id -> UserProfile
        self.interaction_history = {}  # user_id -> [InteractionEvent]
        self.pattern_recognition = {}  # user_id -> RecognizedPatterns
        self.emotional_memory = {}  # user_id -> EmotionalHistory
```

### Phase 2: Personality Recognition
```python
class UserPersonalityRecognizer:
    def analyze_interaction_style(self, user_id, recent_interactions):
        """Analyze user's interaction patterns to identify personality traits"""
        
    def detect_communication_patterns(self, user_id, messages):
        """Identify user's communication preferences and patterns"""
        
    def recognize_emotional_signatures(self, user_id, emotional_contexts):
        """Learn what emotional states the user tends to express"""
```

### Phase 3: Adaptive Relationship Management
```python
class AdaptiveRelationshipManager:
    def update_relationship_model(self, user_id, interaction_event):
        """Update relationship based on new interaction"""
        
    def predict_user_needs(self, user_id, context):
        """Predict what the user might need based on learned patterns"""
        
    def adapt_pet_behavior(self, user_id, current_context):
        """Adjust pet behavior to better match user preferences"""
```

## Benefits of Rich User Modeling

### 1. **Personalized Interactions**
- Pets respond differently to different users
- Communication style adapts to user preferences
- Activities are tailored to user interests

### 2. **Emotional Intelligence**
- Pets remember how interactions made them feel
- They can recognize user emotional states
- They develop genuine emotional bonds

### 3. **Long-term Relationship Development**
- Relationships evolve and deepen over time
- Pets remember important moments and milestones
- They can adapt to user life changes

### 4. **Predictive Behavior**
- Pets can anticipate user needs
- They recognize patterns in user behavior
- They can prepare responses based on context

### 5. **Conflict Resolution**
- Pets remember and learn from negative interactions
- They can adapt to avoid repeating problematic patterns
- They develop forgiveness and understanding

## Example User-Pet Relationship Scenarios

### Scenario 1: The Busy Professional
**User Pattern**: Interacts briefly but consistently, prefers quick responses
**Pet Adaptation**: Learns to be concise, recognizes work hours, provides efficient comfort

### Scenario 2: The Nurturing Caregiver
**User Pattern**: Long, detailed interactions, lots of emotional support
**Pet Adaptation**: Becomes more expressive, shares detailed responses, seeks emotional connection

### Scenario 3: The Playful Friend
**User Pattern**: Loves games, creative interactions, humor
**Pet Adaptation**: Develops playful personality, creates games, uses humor in responses

### Scenario 4: The Inconsistent User
**User Pattern**: Irregular interactions, varying moods and availability
**Pet Adaptation**: Learns to be patient, doesn't take absence personally, adapts to current mood

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Extensions
```sql
-- Enhanced user profiles
CREATE TABLE user_profiles (
    user_id VARCHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
    personality_signature JSON,
    communication_preferences JSON,
    interaction_patterns JSON,
    relationship_history JSON,
    last_updated TIMESTAMP
);

-- Detailed interaction memory
CREATE TABLE pet_user_interactions (
    id VARCHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
    pet_id VARCHAR(36) NOT NULL,
    user_id VARCHAR(36) NOT NULL,
    interaction_type VARCHAR(50),
    emotional_context JSON,
    user_response_pattern JSON,
    pet_emotional_state JSON,
    relationship_impact FLOAT,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (pet_id) REFERENCES pets(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

### Integration with Existing Systems
- **FEP System**: User modeling influences surprise calculations
- **Memory System**: User memories are prioritized and preserved
- **Behavior System**: User preferences influence behavior selection
- **Communication System**: User patterns influence emoji selection

## Future Enhancements

### 1. **Multi-User Relationship Dynamics**
- How pets balance relationships with multiple users
- Relationship jealousy and preference management
- Collaborative user interactions

### 2. **User Life Stage Adaptation**
- Adapting to user life changes (work, relationships, etc.)
- Recognizing and responding to user stress or happiness
- Supporting user through difficult times

### 3. **Cross-Pet User Memory Sharing**
- Pets sharing knowledge about users with each other
- Collaborative user modeling
- Social learning about user preferences

### 4. **Predictive User Modeling**
