# MDP-Inspired Enhancements for FEP System

## Overview

This document outlines the planned enhancements to our current FEP (Free Energy Principle) system by incorporating concepts from Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and the pymdp library. The goal is to create a hybrid system that combines the strengths of both approaches.

## Current System Analysis

Our current FEP system captures core concepts:
- ‚úÖ Predictive coding and active inference
- ‚úÖ Hierarchical processing with attention-based thriving
- ‚úÖ Emoji-based communication
- ‚úÖ Basic state-action mappings

**Missing MDP concepts:**
- ‚ùå Formal generative models (A, B, C matrices)
- ‚ùå Variational message passing
- ‚ùå Policy inference over action sequences
- ‚ùå Categorical state representations
- ‚ùå Precision optimization

## Proposed Enhancements

### 1. Policy Optimization Over Action Sequences

**Current:** Single-step action selection based on immediate state
**Enhanced:** Multi-step policy optimization considering future consequences

```python
# Current approach
action = select_action(current_state)

# Enhanced approach
policy = optimize_policy(current_state, horizon=5)
action_sequence = policy.get_actions()
```

**Benefits:**
- Better long-term planning
- More realistic pet behavior
- Improved interaction quality

### 2. Structured Hierarchical State Representations

**Current:** Flat state vector (20 dimensions)
**Enhanced:** Hierarchical state with categorical and continuous components

```python
# Enhanced state structure
state = {
    'physical': {
        'energy': 0.75,  # continuous
        'mood': 'happy',  # categorical
        'health': 'good'   # categorical
    },
    'social': {
        'attention': 0.65,
        'bond_strength': 0.80
    },
    'cognitive': {
        'thriving': 0.70,
        'curiosity': 0.55
    }
}
```

### 3. Generative Models (A, B, C Matrices)

**A Matrix (Observation Model):** Maps hidden states to observations
**B Matrix (Transition Model):** Maps actions to state transitions  
**C Matrix (Preferences):** Defines preferred observations

```python
# Example generative model structure
A_matrix = {
    'emoji_expression': {
        'happy_state': 0.9,
        'sad_state': 0.1,
        'neutral_state': 0.3
    }
}

B_matrix = {
    'play_action': {
        'energy': {'high': 0.8, 'medium': 0.2},
        'mood': {'happy': 0.9, 'neutral': 0.1}
    }
}
```

### 4. Variational Message Passing

**Current:** Direct state updates
**Enhanced:** Belief propagation with uncertainty handling

```python
# Enhanced belief update
def update_beliefs(observation, action, current_beliefs):
    # Forward pass: predict next state
    predicted_state = transition_model(action, current_beliefs)
    
    # Backward pass: update based on observation
    updated_beliefs = variational_update(observation, predicted_state)
    
    return updated_beliefs
```

### 5. Precision Optimization

**Current:** Fixed attention weights
**Enhanced:** Adaptive precision based on uncertainty and importance

```python
# Precision optimization
def optimize_precision(beliefs, observations):
    uncertainty = compute_uncertainty(beliefs)
    importance = compute_importance(observations)
    precision = uncertainty * importance
    return precision
```

### 6. Enhanced Action Selection with Planning

**Current:** Greedy action selection
**Enhanced:** Planning with lookahead and uncertainty

```python
# Enhanced action selection
def select_action_with_planning(current_state, horizon=3):
    # Generate possible action sequences
    action_sequences = generate_action_sequences(horizon)
    
    # Evaluate each sequence
    evaluations = []
    for sequence in action_sequences:
        expected_outcome = simulate_sequence(current_state, sequence)
        evaluation = evaluate_outcome(expected_outcome)
        evaluations.append(evaluation)
    
    # Select best sequence and return first action
    best_sequence = action_sequences[np.argmax(evaluations)]
    return best_sequence[0]
```

## Phased Integration Strategy
