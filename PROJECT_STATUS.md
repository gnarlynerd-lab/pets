# DKS Digital Pet System - Current Project Status

**Last Updated:** July 3, 2025

## üéØ Project Overview

The DKS Digital Pet System is an innovative digital companion platform that combines:
- **Mesa-based agent modeling** for realistic pet behavior simulation
- **Free Energy Principle (FEP) cognitive system** for advanced AI-driven responses
- **Emoji-based communication** for intuitive user-pet interaction
- **Real-time state synchronization** between backend and frontend
- **Persistent memory and trait evolution** for long-term pet development

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Backend (Python/FastAPI)
- **Core Agent Logic:** `backend/agents/digital_pet.py` - Complete Mesa agent implementation
- **API Layer:** `backend/main.py` - FastAPI endpoints for pet state and interactions
- **Data Persistence:** Redis-based interaction storage and state management
- **Cognitive System:** FEP-based processing for emoji interactions and behavioral responses

### Frontend (React/Next.js)
- **Pet Display:** Interactive visual representation of pet state
- **Emoji Interface:** User-friendly emoji selection and communication
- **Real-time Updates:** Live pet state synchronization via API calls
- **Statistics Dashboard:** Pet health, mood, needs, and trait visualization

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### Core Pet Functionality
- [x] **Mesa Agent Implementation** - Complete digital pet agent with state management
- [x] **Trait System** - Personality traits that evolve based on interactions
- [x] **Needs System** - Hunger, thirst, social, play, and rest needs
- [x] **Memory Systems** - Episodic and semantic memory for learning
- [x] **Relationship Tracking** - User and pet-to-pet relationship management

### Emoji Communication System
- [x] **Emoji Processing** - FEP-based emoji interpretation and response generation
- [x] **Behavioral Responses** - Context-aware pet reactions to emoji inputs
- [x] **Learning Adaptation** - Pet responses improve based on interaction history
- [x] **Communication Statistics** - Tracking of interaction patterns and effectiveness

### API & Data Flow
- [x] **Pet State API** - Flat structure pet state endpoint (`/pet/state`)
- [x] **Emoji Interaction API** - Endpoint for emoji-based communication
- [x] **State Synchronization** - Real-time updates between backend and frontend
- [x] **Error Handling** - Basic error management for API calls

### Frontend Components
- [x] **Pet Display Component** - Visual representation of pet state
- [x] **Pet Stats Component** - Health, mood, energy, and needs display
- [x] **Emoji Interface** - User interaction through emoji selection
- [x] **State Management Hooks** - React hooks for pet state fetching and updates

## üöß Current Status & Pending Issues

### High Priority Fixes - Completed ‚úÖ
1. **RedisManager Argument Error** 
   - Location: Backend emoji interaction endpoint
   - Issue: `store_interaction()` call missing required arguments
   - Fix Applied: Added `sender_id`, `receiver_id`, `message_type`, `content` parameters
   - Status: ‚úÖ Fixed

2. **Frontend State Structure Verification**
   - Confirmed all components use flat pet state structure (not nested `vital_stats`)
   - Verified `use-pet-state.ts` hook compatibility with current API
   - Status: ‚úÖ Verified and compatible

### Testing & Validation - Next Steps
- [ ] **End-to-End Testing** - Full emoji interaction flow
- [ ] **Error Handling Verification** - Robust error management on both ends
- [ ] **Performance Testing** - API response times and frontend responsiveness
- [ ] **State Consistency** - Backend-frontend state synchronization accuracy

Instructions for testing have been added in `RUNNING_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

## üìä Technical Implementation Details

### Pet State Structure
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  health: number,      // 0-100
  mood: number,        // 0-100
  energy: number,      // 0-100
  attention: number,   // 0-100
  age: number,         // seconds since creation
  stage: string,       // development stage
  traits: object,      // personality traits
  needs: object,       // hunger, thirst, social, play, rest
  position: [x, y]     // spatial coordinates
}
```

### Emoji Interaction Flow
1. User selects emoji sequence in frontend
2. Frontend sends POST request to `/pet/emoji-interaction`
3. Backend processes through FEP cognitive system
4. Pet state updates based on interaction
5. Response includes pet emoji reply and behavioral description
6. Frontend updates UI with new pet state and response

## üîß Development Setup

### Backend Requirements
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start backend server
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### Frontend Requirements
```bash
# Install dependencies
cd next
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## üéÆ Current Capabilities

### Pet Behaviors
- **Autonomous Actions** - Pet performs behaviors based on needs and traits
- **Environmental Interaction** - Responds to time, weather, and surroundings
- **Social Dynamics** - Interacts with other pets and users
- **Learning & Adaptation** - Evolves based on interaction patterns

### User Interactions
- **Emoji Communication** - Send emoji sequences and receive pet responses
- **State Monitoring** - Real-time view of pet health, mood, and needs
- **Relationship Building** - Develop bond through consistent interaction
- **Behavioral Influence** - User actions affect pet personality development

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate (Within 1-2 days)
1. ‚úÖ Fix RedisManager argument error in backend (COMPLETED)
2. ‚úÖ Verify frontend component state structure consistency (COMPLETED)
3. Conduct end-to-end testing of emoji interaction flow

### Short Term (Within 1 week)
1. Add comprehensive logging and monitoring
2. Implement pet state persistence to database
3. Add more emoji interaction patterns and responses
4. Create user authentication and multi-pet support

### Medium Term (1-4 weeks)
1. Advanced behavioral modeling and trait evolution
